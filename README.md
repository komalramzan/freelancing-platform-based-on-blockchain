# freelancing-platform-based-on-blockchain
Blockchain technology has immensely effect the payment methods which not only eliminates the necessity of a trusted third party but also provides a distributed shared ledger. This technology will also make freelancing more flexible where you can often work full- or part-time on projects of your choice, at the hours that are convenient for you. We propose an idea where all freelance transactions will get stored on a Blockchain. There will be no middle man in this system hence making it more secure. This will be a portal to find short-term freelance work where clients can upload their projects which freelancers can browse through and pick up. Before a project is assigned, the client will have to deposit the charges in a smart contract. After a project is assigned, any changes to the contract can be done only if it is authorized by both the sides.
